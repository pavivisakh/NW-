In this mini-project, we propose the development of an intelligent system designed to streamline the management of class schedules and faculty availability in colleges. The system offers a comprehensive solution to handle class hours, faculty absences, and student engagement. In the event of a teacher's absence, the system automatically notifies other faculty members teaching the same subject and attempts to reschedule the class with an available teacher. If no substitute teacher is available, the system provides students with alternative learning resources such as notes and reference materials for the specific subject. Additionally, the application allows students to view their timetable, track internal marks, and check the availability of teachers for specific subjects. This integrated solution enhances operational efficiency, supports academic continuity, and improves the overall experience for both students and faculty members.
